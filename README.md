Swift Package for SonarPenKit for iOS
 ===================================

## Requirements

iOS 13.0 or above

## Installation

You can install SonarPenKit through Swift Manager Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding SonarPenKit as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/SonarPen/SonarPenKit", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```
